<h1 align="center">📸 Instagram Profile UI with Uno Platform Hot Design</h1>

A modern, responsive Instagram profile UI built with **Uno Platform Hot Design** and **.NET 9** as part of the Uno Platform Hot Design Challenge.

This project demonstrates how Hot Design and its AI Agent can streamline visual layout, spacing, typography, and component refinement, helping developers build beautiful cross-platform UIs faster and more intuitively.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

### ✨ Real-Time Visual Editing  
Hot Design allowed me to modify margins, padding, colors, iconography, and layout **live** while the app was running — no rebuilds, no reloads.

### 🤖 AI-Assisted UI Enhancements  
The Hot Design Agent helped refine spacing, polish story circles, and improve the grid while keeping the rest of the UI intact.

### 📱 Fully Responsive  
The design works beautifully on both **desktop** and **mobile**, adapting layout, grid sizing, and scaling automatically.

### 🎨 Theme-Aware (Light & Dark Mode)  
The UI respects system theme changes so everything, texts, icons, buttons, backgrounds, adjusts cleanly between light and dark.
